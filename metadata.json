  "description": "Designing the Application Scope\nI'm currently focused on defining the initial scope for this React application. It's becoming clearer that the primary user, a college chairman, will oversee three distinct engineering colleges: BIET, CIT, and DIET. My recent thoughts are centered around the core functionalities necessary for this multi-college management system. I'm exploring the data structures that'll efficiently handle the diverse information required for each institution.\nClarifying Access Controls\n\\n\\nI'm now zeroing in on the Role-Based Access Control implementation. The details are coming into focus, with an emphasis on creating a smooth user experience. I'll start with the Chairman's full-access view as the base, then work backward to simulate the restricted views for HODs and staff. I'm envisioning the \"All Colleges Overview\" dashboard to be a central point. User login will be simulated given the existence of a backend system.\nExpanding the Dashboard Concepts\n\\n\\nI'm now diving deeper into the specifics of the dashboards. The \"All Colleges Overview\" dashboard for the Chairman will aggregate essential data across BIET, BGIIT, and KNRCER. I'm focusing on key metrics like student and faculty attendance, pass percentages, and total student counts. My goal is to present this data in a clear, concise, and easily digestible format. I also have to create college-specific dashboards, tailored for both the Chairman and HODs, that will mirror the overview but reflect the data for a single institution.\nDesigning Data Generation\nI'm now focusing on generating realistic mock data for the application. I've designed logic for admission numbers, faculty IDs, and staff IDs based on the user's templates. I'll be creating a service to populate my data structure with relevant metrics like student and faculty attendance, pass percentages and totals for a frontend-only application. I'm focusing on the Excel templates for marks, attendance, and details to ensure my data mimics a real-world scenario.\nRefining Data Structures\n\\n\\nI'm now focusing on refining the data structures for the frontend application, particularly around the mock data generation. I'm leveraging Excel templates and the defined ID logic to represent realistic student, faculty, and staff data. Currently, I'm working to consolidate the data within the mockDataService to build a complete model of student data, faculty data, staff data, and overall attendance and pass percentages. I'll utilize the data to build out the front end. I'm aiming for a flexible design that can easily accommodate the structure in an Excel file.\nDesigning Data Structures\nI'm now focusing on designing the data structures for the frontend application, particularly around the mock data generation.

I'm focusing on the admission number, faculty ID, and staff ID logic outlined earlier to generate consistent and realistic IDs. I'm building out a series of functions that will generate all attendance, marks, student, staff, and faculty data. I'll test these data structures as I'm building them.\nDeveloping Mock Data Generation\n\\n\\nI'm now deeply immersed in creating the mock data service. I'm focusing on crafting a service to generate all necessary data, including student, faculty, and staff details, alongside their attendance and marks. I'm creating a service for each college, and I'll create logic for attendance and marks using the ID, faculty ID, and Staff ID logic outlined earlier. The generated data will be used to populate frontend dashboards. I'll focus on Excel templates to ensure my data mimics a real-world scenario.\nConstructing Data Logic\n\\n\\nI'm now deep into implementing the mock data service.

I'm building a series of functions to generate all the necessary data, including student attendance, marks, staff data, and faculty data. I'll test these data structures as I'm building them.\nDeveloping Mock Data Generation\n\\n\\nI'm now creating the logic for a robust mock data service. I've designed the admission number, faculty ID, and staff ID generation. I am also working on college-specific data functions. My focus is on generating realistic data for students, faculty, and staff, including attendance and marks. I'll use the Excel templates to ensure accuracy. I will integrate the data across three colleges, building out the dashboards' functionality.\nConstructing the Frontend Data\nI've been working on generating the mock data service. I am now creating a frontend React application, including the UI layout, using Tailwind CSS, and charts from Recharts. I'll simulate a login flow using the user's role. I've designed the student search details modal, the college overview dashboard, and the college dashboard. The dashboard components get generated data from the mock data service.",
